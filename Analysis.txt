I analyzed how the initial structure of the solution would be. 

I created the projects and classes that would be added, then I used a way to load information through the use of a .json file, this to load information outside the application code.
 
I created domain models to validate the information that would enter the system and finally i applied the search logic of words according to the requirement.
